# Face db description

I will use `Face Place` database to complete my project.

Many thanks to [Face Place](http://wiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/Face_Place)!

I modify something of the database, so if you want to run my code and experiment on the datasets, please [email](cugtyt@qq.com) me, you will get a zip file named `data`, unzip it to the root of repo.
